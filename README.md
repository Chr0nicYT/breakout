#Breakout
Have you ever wanted a panel for your minecraft server? One that doesn't cost money for multiple servers (*cough* multicraft *cough*) or a panel that provides barely enough inormation to setup (*cough* pufferpanel *cough*). One that is user friendly, allows multiple admins, and multiple servers all for FREE? Well here it is! Breakout!
This panel has features such as:
Multiple Servers
Multiple Admins
Custom server.properties
Custom server.jar
View Console
Auto IP-Forwarding (IPTABLES)
And a User friendly GUI!
Security Features:
MySQL Injection prevention
RFI Prevention
Wow! That is a lot! Of course, we are still working on more features such as:
RCON Console (send command to console)
FTP Online (Upload server jar included)
Player lists.
Now, let's talk about what makes this panel different than every other. This panel is %100 free! Requires NO bash daemon, and no composer.phar! Just run the install script, navigate to the URL said at the end to complete installation, and your ready to create servers! Also, we listen to you! Have a suggestion? let us know at our github repo (put it under issues). Have a problem! Again, put it under issues on our github. 
Now, screenshots.
